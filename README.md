### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset comprising customer demographics, including factors such as marital status, gender, income, education, occupation, home ownership, vehicle ownership, commute distance, age, and regional location, with a focus on understanding the relationship between these variables and the likelihood of purchasing a bike.

### Data Source

Sale Data: The primary Dataset used for this analysis is "bike_sales_data.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about sales made by the company

### Tools

-Excel- Data Cleaning, Data analysis, Creating report

### Data cleaning/prepation

1. Removed duplicates to ensure unique entries.
2. Handled missing data by filling in or removing rows with null values.
3. Standardized formatting for numerical and categorical fields.
4. Identified and addressed outliers in data (e.g., unusual age or income values).
5. Categorized continuous data into ranges (e.g., income and age brackets).
6. Standardized text formatting to ensure consistency (e.g., consistent case for categorical data).
7. Checked for and corrected errors in data entries where necessary.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) aimed to identify factors influencing bike purchase behavior. Key findings include:

- Which age group is most likely to purchase a bike?
- How does income impact bike purchases?
- How does the distance traveled affect the likelihood of purchasing a bike?


### Data analysis

The data analysis process involved using Excel tools like IF statements, Pivot Tables, and charts to analyze trends in bike purchases based on distance traveled, age, income, and gender.

- IF Statement for Age Groups: An IF statement was used to categorize individuals into age groups (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old) based on their age. This helped in easily analyzing purchasing patterns by age.
- Pivot Table: A Pivot Table was used to summarize the data, allowing for comparisons across categories like distance traveled and age. It helped calculate the number of bike purchases for each segment and facilitated a deeper understanding of purchase trends.
- Other Excel Features: Tools like sorting, filtering, conditional formatting, and charts were used to highlight key insights and visualize the data effectively.

Overall, these methods made it easier to uncover patterns and trends in the data, such as which age groups or distance categories were more likely to purchase bikes.

### Results/Findings

The data analysis reveals the following key insights:

- Distance Traveled: People who travel 0-1 miles are the most likely to purchase bikes, with purchases decreasing as the distance increases. Those traveling more than 10 miles are least likely to buy bikes.
- Age Group: The "Middle Age" group has the highest number of bike purchases, followed by Adolescents. The "Old" group purchases the least number of bikes.
- Income and Gender: Higher-income individuals, particularly males, are more likely to purchase bikes. Males also have a slightly higher average income than females.

These findings highlight the importance of distance, age, income, and gender in determining bike purchase behavior.

### Recommendations

The recommendations based on the analysis are:

- Target Local Areas: Focus marketing efforts on areas where people travel 0-1 miles, as they are most likely to buy bikes.
- Appeal to Middle-Aged Demographic: Tailor campaigns and products to the Middle Age group, highlighting convenience and health benefits.
- Market to Older Consumers: Develop bikes suited for older individuals (e.g., electric bikes) to increase their engagement.
- Focus on High-Income Consumers: Offer premium bikes and accessories targeted at high-income individuals, particularly males.
- Gender-Specific Marketing: Create campaigns and products specifically designed to appeal to male and female consumers.
- Customized Promotions: Offer tailored promotions based on age and travel distance to boost bike purchases in relevant segments.

These recommendations aim to optimize sales by aligning marketing strategies with customer behaviors.
